        </h4>
        <p>Based on my interst i started a youtube channel and an instagram account to post anime content.
            How ever the growth on Instagram is for more gteater than on Youtube.
            <br>
            Actually I started first YT Channel with the name of "Yeah Anime Senpai" and got 75K Views.
            And 80 subscribers.
            And also got a fucking youtube strike and lost intrest on that channel.
            <br>
            Then again Started another channel,now it is named as 'First_Uchiha'.yeah it was started more recently didn't get enough support like the first one. And i am trying my fucking best to grow and i will do what ever it takes.
            And coming to my IG ,it's more supportive getting average of 8k views on each and 500+ likes ,i think it's good enough for a bigginer.
